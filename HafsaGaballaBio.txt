My name is Hafsa Gaballa and I'm a freshman computer science major at Drexel. I'm interested in 
areas of Human-Computer Interaction as well as Penetration Methods within the cybersecurity field.
I'm looking to develop my technical skills in both fields of Computer Science and Cybersecurity in order
to further progress my career within the tech world.
